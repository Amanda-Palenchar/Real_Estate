### Overview
The goal of this project is to determine if a connection exists between home values and the home proximity to a grocery store, specifically Trader Joe's and Walmart. Proximity to a grocery store, among other features (beds, baths, square footage), is then used to create a Flask App that will predict home prices.

**Essential Question:** What is the correlation between home value and proximity to Trader Joeâ€™s or Walmart?

### Datasets
The real estate dataset that was used for this analysis (over 900,000 lines of data) and the subsequent clean dataset that was created after the ETL process were too large to push to GitHub. However, the initial datasets are available on Kaggle at the following links and running the code in Data_Cleaning folder will yield a clean dataset to use for the machine learning model.
